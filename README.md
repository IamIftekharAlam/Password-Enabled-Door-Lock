# Password-Enabled-Door-Lock
The project aims to create a door lock the does not require a key to lock or unlock the door. In this project the lock of the door is password  enabled. There is a keypad  on the door.Also there is a display. The owner simply types the password and the lock opens. The password is of 6 digits. If the password is wrong the door does not open and displays that the entered password is incorrect. This removes the inconvenience of  carrying a key in your pocket all the time. Moreover it is hard to enter the house if the key is lost. Doors need to be broken in order to open if the key is lost. This is very safe as the  lock is hard to bypass. Moreover thieves could open the traditional lock with some customized key, but this is not possible in case of this password enabled lock. This is an Arduino based project.
